# âš¡ Elastic API & Threat Detection Rules

A practical project showcasing how to use **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** for both log management and security monitoring.  
It walks through CRUD operations, ingestion pipelines, and building custom threat detection rules to spot suspicious PowerShell activity.
